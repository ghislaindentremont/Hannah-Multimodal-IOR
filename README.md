# Ghis-Multimodal-IOR
Cognitive Psychology/Neuroscience Stuty - Experiment and Analysis Script 

NOTE: Mike Lawrence helped designed, and almost entirely coded the script (experiment.py) for this experiment for which I am the principal investigator under the supervision of Raymond Klein.
      The original repository, which no longer will be updated, can be found at https://github.com/mike-lawrence/multimodal_ior.
      It was easier, moving forward, for me to create the current repository to track changes to this on going study which will be modified slightly and for which there may be a follow-up.
      
[ABSTRACT]
Inhibition of Return (IOR) is a behavioral phenomenon wherein one is slower to respond to targets that are presented at 
a previously cued location. Early work looking at the event-related potential (ERP) components of IOR using 
electroencephalography (EEG) suggested that P1 reductions might be an electrophysiological marker of IOR. However, the 
observation of P1 reductions with and without IOR, and vice versa, made the role of P1 in IOR unclear. We hypothesized that 
P1 component reductions, and, more generally, early ERP component modulations, are the result of repetitive stimulation along 
an input (sensory) pathway, not IOR. To test this hypothesis, the neural signature of IOR was investigated in a multi-modal 
cueing paradigm using all possible pairings of touch and vision.
