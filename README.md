[ABSTRACT]
Inhibition of Return (IOR) is a behavioral phenomenon wherein one is slower to respond to targets that are presented at 
a previously cued location. Early work looking at the event-related potential (ERP) components of IOR using 
electroencephalography (EEG) suggested that P1 reductions might be an electrophysiological marker of IOR. However, the 
observation of P1 reductions with and without IOR, and vice versa, made the role of P1 in IOR unclear. We hypothesized that 
P1 component reductions, and, more generally, early ERP component modulations, are the result of repetitive stimulation along 
an input (sensory) pathway, not IOR. To test this hypothesis, the neural signature of IOR was investigated in a multi-modal 
cueing paradigm using pairings of touch and vision.
